## Initial Setup

Unified Ecommerce follows the same [initial setup steps outlined in the common OL web app guide](https://mitodl.github.io/handbook/how-to/common-web-app-guide.html).
Run through those steps **including the addition of `/etc/hosts` aliases and the optional step for running the
`createsuperuser` command**.

Additionally, you will need a Keycloak instance set up with a realm for the application. The realm can be an existing one (and should if you want to use the same accounts from another integrated app). The application needs a service account for the app (so it can pull user information) in the _master_ realm and a client.

### Configure required `.env` settings

The following settings must be configured before running the app:

- `MITOL_UE_HOSTNAME`

  Sets the hostname required by webpack for building the frontend. Should likely be whatever you set
  the host to in your /etc/hosts or the hostname that you're accessing it from. Likely `ue.odl.local`.

- `SECRET_KEY`

  Sets the Django secret for the application. This just needs to be a random string.

- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`

  Sets the client ID for the service account. (This should be in the `master` realm.)

- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`

  Sets the client secret for the service account.

- `KEYCLOAK_URL`

  Sets the base URL for the Keycloak instance. Do not append a trailing slash.

- `KEYCLOAK_REALM`

  Sets the realm name that the application should use.

If you're going to use the included Traefik Composer environment, also set these:

- `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`

  Sets the client ID for authentication within the realm.

- `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`

  Sets the client secret for authentication within the realm.

- `TRAEFIK_SECRET`

  Sets the secret Traefik will use for cookie generation (works like the Django `SECRET_KEY`).

### Loading and Accessing Data

You'll need an integrated system and product for that system to be able to do much of anything. Once you've done initial setup, run these commands:

* Create an integrated system: `./manage.py add_system <name> -d <description> -s <slug`
* Create a product: `./manage.py manage_product add -s <system slug> --sku <an SKU> --name <name> --description <description> --price <price>`

The `add_system` command will generate an API key for the system's use. You can add as many systems as you wish.

> Alternatively, you can create these records through the Django Admin, but be advised that it won't create the API key for you. The management command uses a UUID for the key but any value will do, as long as it's unique.

You can interact with the API directly through the Swagger interface: `<root url>/api/schema/swagger-ui/`

The system also exposes a Redoc version of the API at `<root url>/api/schema/redoc/`

Navigating to an API endpoint in the browser should also get you the normal DRF interface as well.

> Most API endpoints will require a session of some kind. See Run with API Gateway below for more info. But, the integrated systems and products APIs are anoymous read-only, so you should be able to get something out of them without having the API gateway set up.

### Run with API Gateway

The app depends on an outside system to provide the authentication layer for itself. This outside system is an API gateway. We've specifically tested two: Traefik Proxy and APISIX.

#### Traefik

The base `docker-compose.yml` has labels added to support running this with Traefik on your local machine. Traefik can run outside of the UE Compose environment - it wiill pick up the configuration it needs automatically. The Compose file expects the Traefik network to be named `traefik-keycloak_default`. You will need a ForwardAuth configured to forward authentication to your Keycloak instance for auth. (The app then uses `X-Forwarded-User` to figure out who the user is.)

If you don't have a Traefik instance set up, there's a `docker-compose-traefik.yml` file that you can use to set up a basic environment with a ForwardAuth that'll work for the app. Make sure the environment settings are set up properly (see above) and then bring the Compose environment up _in its own project_ - e.g., `docker-compose up -p traefik-keycloak -f docker-compose-traefik.yml`. If your project name is different, you'll have to change the base docker-compose file or create an override so that the `nginx` container sits in the right network.

#### Others (APISIX)

The system is also set up to run using APISIX as the gateway (to an extent). Use the `docker-compose-apisix.yml` file to spin up the application with APISIX and etcd. You will need to define routes for the app and set up forward auth on your own.

## Code Generation

Unified Ecommerce uses [drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate an OpenAPI spec from Django views. Additionally, we use [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to generate Typescript declarations and an API Client. These generated files are checked into source control; CI checks that they are up-to-date. To regenerate these files, run

```bash
./scripts/generate_openapi.sh
```

## Committing & Formatting

To ensure commits to GitHub are safe, first install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```
pip install pre_commit
pre-commit install
```

Running pre-commit can confirm your commit is safe to be pushed to GitHub and correctly formatted:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To automatically install precommit hooks when cloning a repo, you can run this:

```
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
```

## Optional Setup

Described below are some setup steps that are not strictly necessary for running Unified Ecommerce.

### Running the app in a notebook

This repo includes a config for running a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in a Docker container. This enables you to do in a Jupyter notebook anything you might otherwise do in a Django shell. To get started:

- Copy the example file
  ```bash
  # Choose any name for the resulting .ipynb file
  cp app.ipynb.example app.ipynb
  ```
- Build the `notebook` container _(for first time use, or when requirements change)_
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose-notebook.yml build
  ```
- Run all the standard containers (`docker compose up`)
- In another terminal window, run the `notebook` container
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose-notebook.yml run --rm --service-ports notebook
  ```
- The notebook container log output will indicate a URL at which you can interact with the notebook server.
- After visiting the notebook url, click the `.ipynb` file that you created to run the notebook
- Execute the first block to confirm it's working properly (click inside the block and press Shift+Enter)

From there, you should be able to run code snippets with a live Django app just like you would in a Django shell.
